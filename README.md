## Installation

N/A

## Usage 

This tool was created to practice the following skills:
- Using Markdown to write a README

#### The work done can be found on the GitHub repository [zahirovic/Text-Editor](https://github.com/zahirovic/Text-Editor).

- The deployed application can be found on [Heroku](https://text-editor-mz.herokuapp.com/) and should look along the lines of this depending on screen size:
